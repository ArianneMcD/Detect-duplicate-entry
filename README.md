# Detect-duplicate-entry
Write a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument, and checks if any of the numbers are repeated. If any number is repeated, the function should return True. If every number if unique, the function should return False. 

E.g. for input nums = [1,2,3,1], the function should return True because 1 is repeated 

for input nums = [1,2,3,4] the function should return False since no item is repeated
